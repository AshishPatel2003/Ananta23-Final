          contract with the Event Management Body and affects your rights. It
          contains procedures for MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION AND A CLASS
          ACTION WAIVER.
        </p>
        <p className="font-bold">Applicability of Arbitration Agreement</p>
        <p>
          All claims and disputes in connection with the Terms or the use of any
          product or service provided by the Event Management Body that cannot
          be resolved informally or in small claims court shall be resolved by
          binding arbitration on an individual basis under the terms of this
          Arbitration Agreement. Unless otherwise agreed to, all arbitration
          proceedings shall be held in English. This Arbitration Agreement
          applies to you and the Event Management Body, and any subsidiaries,
          affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors,
          and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or

        </p>
        <p className="font-bold">Notice Requirement and Informal Dispute Resolution</p>
        <p>
          Before either party may seek arbitration, the party must first send to
          the other party a written Notice of Dispute describing the nature and
          basis of the claim or dispute and the requested relief. A Notice to
          the Event Management Body should be sent to the Ananta Team. After the
          Notice is received, you and the Event Management Body may attempt to
          resolve the claim or dispute informally. If you and the Event
          Management Body do not resolve the claim or dispute within thirty (30)
          days after the Notice is received, either party may begin an
          arbitration proceeding. The amount of any settlement offer made by any
          party may not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the
          arbitrator has determined the amount of the award to which either
          party is entitled.
        </p>
        <p className="font-bold">Settlement</p>
        <p>
          All disputes shall be settled by the Event Management Body and the
          User mutually and either of them have no right to approach the court.
        </p>
        <p className="font-bold">Electronic Communications</p>

          whether the Event Management Body posts notices on the Site or
          communicates with you via email. For contractual purposes, you (a)
          consent to receive communications from Event Management Body in an
          electronic form; and (b) agree that all terms and conditions,

          contractor, and neither party is an agent or partner of the other.

          assigned, subcontracted, delegated, or otherwise transferred by you
          without Event Management Body’s prior written consent, and any
