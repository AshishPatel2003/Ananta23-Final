                ANANTA'22 will continue the legacy of our previous fest with the aim to bring together people from all sections of society to commemorate the evergrowing marvels and advancements of technology with the theme “Multiverse of Technology”. During our previous fest, we got an inaugural moment from none other than the MITRA robot with Treasure Hunt, Robo War, a performance from “The Diversity” and Sunburn Campus feat. Dual Vibes.
